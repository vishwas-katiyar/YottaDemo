00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The world's largest wilderness is on the western edge of India. 
1 
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Rann of Kutch, a huge salt lake 
1 
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Once upon a time this was also part of the ocean 
1 
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But during thousands of years such geographical changes took place that it became the largest salt pond in the world. This barren desert spread over about twenty thousand square kilometers. 
1 
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Where once resided one of the greatest cities in the unknown history of India. 
1 
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Dholavira of Harappa 
1 
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It was discovered in 1956 but the remains of Dholavira remained buried in the ground for thirty-five years. 
1 
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The excavation of Dholavira started in 1990. The work was very laborious. 
1 
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Precious things were found after many years of excavation 
1 
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But one day a strange thing happened 
1 
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
A white stone was seen coming out of the ground. 
1 
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Then symbols started appearing which probably belonged to some ancient language or code or perhaps from some other world, such a thing had never been found here before. 
1 
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Could it reveal the hidden secrets of the Indus Valley Civilization? 
1 
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Whose key is hidden in a language that no one has been able to understand till now 
1 
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
A total of ten symbols were found one after the other 
1 
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
were all made of white gypsum 
1 
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The most shocking and best thing about the discovery made in Dholavira is that bones and logistics were found near the base of the gate of that city and it may have been a signboard at that time. 
1 
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:36.000
But we do not know what is written on it and the biggest reason why we do not know is that we cannot read it, so the problem with the Harappan inscriptions is that till date we have not been able to find anyone to read them. 
1 
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
haven't been able to understand them yet 
1 
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
That is why the symbols of Dholavira remain a secret even today. 
1 
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Dholavira, located in today's Kutch district of Gujarat, was once a part of the Indus Valley Civilization and one of its finest cities. 
1 
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Archeology believes that it is spread over about one hundred and twenty acres. 
1 
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
was five thousand years old 
1 
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Older than the Great Pyramid of Egypt 
1 
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Dholavira remained inhabited for about one and a half thousand years 
1 
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The people of Dholavira were very civilized people. 
1 
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
They had very advanced technology even at that time 
1 
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Think for yourself, in three thousand six hundred and twenty AD, they had made drains under the ground, they had baked bricks and there was a city which was settled according to a plan. 
1 
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:56.000
That city was built on a platform, which means that he knew about civic planning, he had a very good understanding of Trigun Maitri, he had an idea of ​​ratios and he knew the calculations which are necessary to establish a metropolis. 
1 
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But who were the people who settled this ancient city? 
1 
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
He used the May Tree at a time when the world did not even know about it 
1 
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000
We will never know whether our ancestors made clay models to build their cities. 
1 
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
But there is no doubt that he had knowledge of civil engineering, geology and hydrological. 
1 
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Dholavira was a city of that time which had a very good water system. 
1 
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
This city was situated between two rivers 
1 
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Mana river used to flow in the north and Manhar river in the south. Both the rivers were connected by interconnected tanks built across the city. Today in the twenty-first century, there is a shortage of drinking water all over the world and due to which wars can happen. He had controlled the water in Dholavira, those channels 
1 
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And we used to use dams, we can use those things today by taking advice from Dholavira. 
1 
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Five thousand years ago Dholavira was a very busy port in the Arabian Sea and trade was at its peak. 
1 
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And the people here were planning to export 
1 
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Beads made in Dholavira have been found as far as Mesopotamia, i.e. in today's Iraq. 
1 
00:05:46.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It was not possible to find out about Dholavira as to how he suddenly disappeared. Dholavira belonged to that era, an advanced civilization had harnessed the powers of nature. People did business all over the world. Its population was several thousand and he suddenly disappeared. What was the reason, most of the researchers 
1 
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Know that the biggest reason was climate change 
1 
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
After this, the ancient people of India took their secrets with them and went somewhere else. 
1 
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.000
What happened to his writings? Where did his technology for building the city go? Where did all this disappear? On finding answers to these questions, only more questions arise. 
1 
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
We are still trying to get information about Dholavira 
1 
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
But perhaps most of his secrets will remain as mysterious as his coat
